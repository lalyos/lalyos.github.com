    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm experimenting with <a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/">ansibe</a>, an awesome IT orchestration engine. It deservse its own blog entry, but in short: <strong>It's an alternative of puppet and chef, but its much easier to learn</strong>, and dowsn't require any client side agent installation.</p>

<h2>passwordless ssh</h2>

<p>Its higly recommended to use public key authentication, but sometimes you have to deal with passwords. Let's say a fresh virtual environment is always created with a default password.</p>

<p>When I tried to call ansible with <strong>-k</strong> password, meaning ask for password, i faced the following message:</p>

<p><code>
to use the 'ssh' connection type with passwords, you must install the sshpass program
</code></p>

<h2>installing sshpass</h2>

<p>Installing sshpass on linux is as easy as calling <em>apt-get</em> or <em>yum</em>, whatever package manager its using. Unfortunately <strong>homebrwe</strong>, my favourite package manager for mac doesn't supports this package officially.</p>

<p>Actually it was created, but the team refused to take <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/9577">it</a> as its a bad practice to put passwords into scripts.</p>

<p>However there is an unofficial brew package:</p>

<p><code>
brew install https://raw.github.com/eugeneoden/homebrew/eca9de1/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb
</code></p>
